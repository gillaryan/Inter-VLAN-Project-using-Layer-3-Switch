# Inter-VLAN Project using Layer-3 Switch

In this project, I used Packet Tracer to design and implement inter-VLAN routing within a network comprising 4 PCs, 2 routers, and a Layer 3 switch. The setup was designed to enable communication between two distinct VLANs.


Key Components:

VLANs and Layer 3 Switch:   Configured VLANs on a Layer 3 switch to segment the network into separate broadcast domains. The switch performed inter-VLAN routing, allowing devices in different VLANs to communicate seamlessly.

Routers:   Deployed two routers to facilitate routing between VLANs, ensuring proper data flow across the network. The routers connected the Layer 3 switch to the broader network, providing necessary routing functionality.

Trunking:   Implemented trunk ports between the Layer 3 switch and the routers to carry traffic from multiple VLANs across a single physical link. This setup allowed VLAN tagging and efficient management of inter-VLAN traffic.


Additional Insights:

Trunking: Enabled trunking to support multiple VLANs over a single link, optimizing the use of network resources and ensuring that VLAN information was preserved as traffic traversed the network.


This project demonstrates the practical application of inter-VLAN routing with a Layer 3 switch and routers, highlighting the importance of trunking in managing VLAN traffic and maintaining a well-structured network.
